# Cash Flow Calculation | Summer 2021
This is the repository for some of the internship work done at China Galaxy Securities during Summer 2021. It aims to develop a cash flow calculation program that will automatically compute the cash flow of the financial products that the team intends to issue after importing all the contract ledgers, and the programming language is Python. For the sake of confidentiality, other specific content such as ledgers and program running demo cannot be uploaded for external display. Please feel free to email me at rd2910@nyu.edu for any more information.
